# DeleteItem

### Store.delete()

```tsx
import { Store } from '@declanprice/noxa'

const store = new Store('customers', new new DynamoDBClient())

const delete = await store.delete<CustomerItem>();
```

### key(itemKey)

Delete item must always contain an key object.

```tsx
delete.key({ id: customer.id });
```

### condition(...conditions)

Delete item can optionally provide any combination of conditions that must be met for the request to succeed, conditions must always be seperated by either and(), or() conditions otherwise an error fill be thrown.

Conditions only apply to the current item being deleted.

```tsx
delete.condition(
    eq('name', 'declan'),
    and(),
    gt('age', 22)
);
```

### returnOld()

Delete item can optionally return the old item as part of the response.

```tsx
delete.returnOld()
```

### exec()

Delete item will only be run once you specifically execute it.

The response from exec will either be the old unmarshalled item if `returnOld` is specified, otherwise it will be null.

```tsx
const oldCustomer: Customer = await delete.exec();

await delete.exec();
```

### tx()

Delete item can be used within a transaction

```tsx
const customerTx: Customer = delete.tx();

await transactWriteItems(customerTx);
```
